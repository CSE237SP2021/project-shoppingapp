# Shopping Application

## Team members

Andy Wu, Flamsteed Zhao, James Guo

## Project Description

This is a command line shopping application implemented with Java. At the end of the project, we plan to implement a complete shopping app with a main menu, items page, and a shopping cart page. If time allows, a user profile page would also be constructed. 

For best practice, we use Git(version control), JUnit tests for code quality control; we also hold weekly meetings to make sure every team member is on the right track.

## Project Iterations

### Iteration 1

* What user stories were completed this iteration?

* What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?

* Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?

* What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
