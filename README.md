# Shopping Application

## Team members

## Project Description

This is a command line shopping application implemented with Java. At the end of the project, we plan to implement a complete shopping app with a main menu, items page, and a shopping cart page. If time allows, a user profile page would also be constructed. 

For best practice, we use Git(version control), JUnit tests for code quality control; we also hold weekly meetings to make sure every team member is on the right track.

## Project Iterations

  * The shop menu page option "View cart" functions well.
  * Users can check out the products in the cart
  
* Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
  * N/A

* What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
  * `./run.sh`

### Iteration 2

* What user stories were completed this iteration?
  * Users can view the items in the cart
